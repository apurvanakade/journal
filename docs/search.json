Now in the new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again starting to write again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, teaching learning, Lean, programming, meditation, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…\nFor me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. Feynman once said “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that. \nSo here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings."

However, hearing this quote at the end of a science podcast really caught me off-guard and made me see it from a different perspective. I can’t pinpoint exactly what this feeling is, but I feel a tingling sensation hinting at something deeper.\nWhat is it that I’m not seeing? Is it related to my life? My work? Teaching? Meditation?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are two ways of approaching any task and life in general:\n\ngoal oriented\nprocess oriented\n\nFor some reason, very likely a mix of cultural and biological, the default is the first approach. You do things in order to get somewhere, to accomplish something.\nOne of the most important teachings of the various contemplative traditions like Buddhism, Stoicism is that in order to find any semblance of equanimity you need to take the process oriented approach - love the process. The goal is often unattainable and impractical and even when it is attained the attainment itself is momentary and fleeting and once you’re done with it you’re left with a hollowness and a lack of direction.\nIf you want to run regularly, then you cannot make your running contingent on the next marathon. Every marathon will be over sooner than you’d like. And there will inevitably be long stretches of time in your life when you won’t be able to participate in any running events. If you truly want to become a runner then you should enjoy the process of running for its own sake. You should participate in running events because you’re a runner and not the other way around.\nThe book “Atomic Habits” has a very good way of putting this - instead of saying that you want to run, you phrase it as you want to become a runner. Instead of saying that you want to read x number of books each year, you say that you want to become an avid reader. This moves the focus from the goal to the process itself.\nYou can extend this to the broader extent of life. You cannot decide to work hard because you want to accomplish certain goals. Rather you’re able to accomplish your goals in life because you’re a hard working person. The arrow of causality points in the other direction."

    "text": "On one of my long drives recently, I was listening to the Smartless episode featuring Willem Dafoe.\nHe shared a perspective that resonated with me. Although he’s American, he lives in Italy, making him an immigrant there. He mentioned that being an immigrant is a liberating experience for him, allowing him to see things from a distance, with an outsider’s perspective.\nI’d never considered it, but it rings true for me as well. Being an immigrant in America, I have the unique vantage point to observe the absurdities, joys, and sorrows of this place, but from a distance. Having lived in another country gives me a completely different perspective, knowing how things could be elsewhere. I can never become too myopic here, as I never get too close to things. There is a sad yet liberating quality to it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hollow Knight is one of the best video games I’ve ever played. I used to play a lot of games during my school and college days but took a break during grad school. I recently resumed playing video games and stumbled upon Hollow Knight by chance.\nI began the game unenthusiastically, assuming it would be about a cute little bug navigating Hallownest. I was completely mistaken. This is one of the most brutal and challenging games ever made. The realization hits when you face your first boss. The game shifts from casual to intense in an instant.\nWhat sets this game apart – aside from the gameplay, music, ambiance, themes, lore, story, graphics, essentially everything – is the uncompromising attitude of the designers. The boss fights are insanely challenging, but they are manageable with enough practice. You need to grind, observe, and learn all the boss moves before even thinking of attacking them.\nAs you delve deeper into the game, the challenge extends beyond the boss fights. The late-game levels, like DeepNest, are tough and require significant effort to clear.\nFurthermore, the game lacks manuals or instructions. You learn by doing. Even the maps are initially hidden, encouraging you to explore and learn Hallownest through exploration.\nNow that the game is popular, the genius of Team Cherry, its creators, is evident. Their vision and commitment are unparalleled. But I wonder about their thought process during development. They must have received feedback about the difficulty of some bosses or the need for easier navigation, yet they remained true to their convictions. They trusted that players would possess the grit and enthusiasm to keep grinding and learning, a testament to their faith in people and their game’s ability to engage players.\n\nOutside gaming, Hollow Knight has impacted my life significantly.\n\nIt has made me more optimistic about humanity. Watching countless speedruns and meme runs on YouTube, I’m constantly aware of my skill level. Seeing the heights people can reach with dedicated practice is humbling and amazing. It shows our great capacity for learning and adapting.\nIt has made me realize my love for challenges. Despite the stress and difficulty of clearing hard levels and boss fights, the satisfaction at the end is immense. There are bosses and levels I may never clear, but I enjoy improving with each attempt. It’s a wonderful metaphor for life.\nSurprisingly, it has also influenced my teaching. My courses are challenging, and my exams are generally tough. I used to feel guilty and considered toning it down, but not anymore. I don’t mind the difficulty of my courses or exams, as long as they provide students with ample opportunity to practice, learn, and grow. Some students may excel and do ‘speedruns’, while others might struggle with harder levels – and that’s okay. The joy lies in the process, not the destination."

    "text": "I’m putting this post here mainly as a bookmark to myself. Sam Harris mentioned this podcast in one of his discussions and so I had a listen.\nI don’t remember much about it’s content but I remember thinking just how much William James already knew about psychology and how well he understood the the human mind to make all these claims without doing any scientific research. Of course, he must have read several religious and philosophical texts of his time and infered based on them. But to synthesize something so precise and practical from these abstract and often incorrect sources is nothing short of genius. Having never done any experiments, his claims cannot be called scientific or even emperical, nevertheless as works of fiction and philosophy they contain great ideas that we can investigate today using the scientific method.\nMy recollection is that in his thesis James concludes that the human society relies entirely on habits and that there is no greater endeavor than to develop good habits. He even lays out some suggestions as to how to go about doing this. I couldn’t agree more.\nI will listen to this episode again and take notes."

Every ending is going to be sorrowful in its own way - and isn’t that true about life itself? Yet you endure with patience, waiting for your chance to cry at an incomplete catharsis.\nThis could be one of the finest films I’ve ever watched."

I probably take longer breaks, get sidetracked by my phone, or choose lighter weights when I could handle heavier ones.\nWe can often push ourselves more than we think. I never knew an hour-long HIIT session with weights, like Yoga Sculpt, was something I could do. I’m surprised I hadn’t tried it earlier.\n\nI once tried a yoga class via livestream, but it didn’t feel the same. The poses might have been identical, but the intensity was different.\nI’ve started to see the benefits of group classes. They push you harder and offer new experiences you might not encounter otherwise."

I immediately realized that this wasn’t another internet troll but a master at his craft.\nI love that when I open his videos, most of the time I do not know what’s going to happen. And yet, I’m somehow convinced that the video is going to go well! Behind his “bro” facade he is a master storyteller. Rather, his “bro” facade is part of his storytelling act.\nI also love his cinematography, editing, music mixing, just everything. Never a boring video.\nI’m writing all this because I learned about his work ethic and feel very inspired by it. For quite some time now, I have been struggling with my sleep and work routine. I’m slowly improving but as I’m writing this I’m realizing that I lack role models in this area. The people in my life either don’t do work they like or work hard obsessively for the sake or working hard. But now I have Neistat! He is someone whose work and skill I admire and understand and whose work ethic I hope to emulate.\nI hope that this is the kick I needed to pull myself up by the bootstraps. Of course, I feel very motivated and inspired now but the real test is whether this is going to last. Only time will tell."

As a result of which, my routine has been completely upended, and my habits are in complete disarray.\nI came across this post on Stoicism (something I greatly admire) which, among other things, talks about starting your day right. This made me realize how I’ve been swept up by the unproductive habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.\nFortunately, I’ve just finished assembling my writing desk by a lovely corner window. My coffee is brewing and my trusty iPad is charged. Time to get back to morning journaling again.

    "section": "",
    "text": "James Clear, the author of “Atomic Habits,” has a quote: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”\nI experienced this just today. I completed a five-day hiking trip through the Mojave Desert in Joshua Tree National Park. It was difficult, tiring, exhilarating, and rewarding - everything you’d expect. On the long walks, I brainstormed ways to improve my life, made many plans for the future, and ended up feeling very optimistic.\nHowever, when the trip ended, I just crashed. Surprisingly, I was not mentally or physically exhausted and needed no time to recover. But I had lost my “systems.” During the hikes, I woke up, had breakfast, drove to the trailheads, hiked, returned to the campsite, had dinner, and went to bed. This routine was my daily pattern. Suddenly, I needed to decide what to do next, and I couldn’t do it effectively. I ended up wasting an entire day watching meaningless videos.\n“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”\nTo maintain the mental state I achieved during the trip and act on any of the ideas I had, the first thing I need to do is develop good “systems,” i.e., habits and routines. These need to be simple and maintainable.\nMy first goal, which is more of a habit, is to wake up every day at 6 a.m., no matter what. If I go to bed late, too bad for me. I will also try to avoid drinking coffee, taking naps during the day, and consuming alcohol. The latter are not difficult as long as I can stick to the first one.\nIf possible, I’d also like to go for a run, walk, or bike ride as soon as I wake up. When I was hiking, one thing I loved was waking up to the fresh, cold morning air. I suspect it set an uplifting tone for the rest of the day."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a podcast episode on waking up, Oliver Burkeman talks about the necessity to say no to certain things in life because you only have a finite amount of time. This becomes clear when you do the calculation involving the time available and the time required to get things done. This is further emphasized by the fact that we don’t always have the will, energy, or capacity to do the things we would like to do.\nTwo things worth pointing out:\n\nYou have to learn to say no to things that you want to do. Just yesterday, I was at a yoga class which was overcrowded. I usually love staying for the final resting pose but I knew that if I stayed until the end, it would take me forever to leave. So, reluctantly, I left early. I still got most of the benefits of the class and managed to leave on time by making a small sacrifice.\nThere is a difference between conceptually understanding something and experientially understanding it. The effect a concept has on your life is much greater once you’ve internalized it. Even though it’s obvious that you have to say no to things, we don’t always do it. And even when we do, we tend to feel guilty or irritated about it. One has to realize that there is just no alternative. This is a consequence of our finiteness that we need to accept and move on."

It’s a perfect place for long-distance biking but an extremely boring one for hiking.\nI hiked the Loudon Heights trail at Harper’s Ferry and absolutely loved it. It was a bit tedious at first with no change in scenery - but that’s the whole point of hiking. It’s not about change, or being comfortable, or getting somewhere, but the journey itself. You walk for hours, letting your mind settle down and taking in the beauty of your surroundings. There’s a deep, ancient instinct that kicks in when you find yourself so close to nature. This feeling is hard to describe and equally hard to recollect.\nWhen I hadn’t hiked for so long, I didn’t particularly miss it, but I was also slowly forgetting how much I liked it. It is a precious thing that I hope I don’t lose as I get busy with life."
