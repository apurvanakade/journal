    "text": "I try to stay away from the internet meme culture as much as possible. I no longer find it funny to make fun of people unintentionally (I do still love absurd humor and find many of the controversial comics funny).\nI saw a Casey Neistat thumbnail on Nerdwriter1’s channel but I stayed away from it thinking that he’s just another internet meme personality.\nBut for some reason, I watched one video of Neistat and got hooked. I immediately realized that this wasn’t another internet troll but a master at his craft.\nI love that when I open his videos, most of the time I do not know what’s going to happen. And yet, I’m somehow convinced that the video is going to go well! Behind his “bro” facade he is a master storyteller. Rather, his “bro” facade is part of his storytelling act.\nI also love his cinematography, editing, music mixing, just everything. Never a boring video.\nI’m writing all this because I learned about his work ethic and feel very inspired by it. For quite some time now, I have been struggling with my sleep and work routine. I’m slowly improving but as I’m writing this I’m realizing that I lack role models in this area. The people in my life either don’t do work they like or work hard obsessively for the sake or working hard. But now I have Neistat! He is someone whose work and skill I admire and understand and whose work ethic I hope to emulate.\nI hope that this is the kick I needed to pull myself up by the bootstraps. Of course, I feel very motivated and inspired now but the real test is whether this is going to last. Only time will tell."

While my life isn’t as dramatic as the characters’, there is something about the immigrant experience that is so uniquely captured by the film.\nNot too far into the movie, you realize that there cannot be any happy ending here. Every ending is going to be sorrowful in its own way - and isn’t that true about life itself? Yet you endure with patience, waiting for your chance to cry at an incomplete catharsis.\nThis could be one of the finest films I’ve ever watched."

    "text": "I’m putting this post here mainly as a bookmark to myself. Sam Harris mentioned this podcast in one of his discussions and so I had a listen.\nI don’t remember much about it’s content but I remember thinking just how much William James already knew about psychology and how well he understood the the human mind to make all these claims without doing any scientific research. Of course, he must have read several religious and philosophical texts of his time and infered based on them. But to synthesize something so precise and practical from these abstract and often incorrect sources is nothing short of genius. Having never done any experiments, his claims cannot be called scientific or even emperical, nevertheless as works of fiction and philosophy they contain great ideas that we can investigate today using the scientific method.\nMy recollection is that in his thesis James concludes that the human society relies entirely on habits and that there is no greater endeavor than to develop good habits. He even lays out some suggestions as to how to go about doing this. I couldn’t agree more.\nI will listen to this episode again and take notes."

If I were to buy any of these then it would be Wavelength. All the others were card games and fun to play with people who have never played board games before."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hollow Knight is one of the best video games I’ve ever played. I used to played a lot of games when I was in school and college but then took a break during my grad school. I recently started playing video games again and happened to accidentally run into Hollow Knight.\nI started the game unenthusiatically, thinking that it was going to be a game about a cute little bug navigating Hollownest. I could not have been more wrong. This is one of the most brutal and challenging games ever made. You start realizing this when you encounter your first boss. The game goes from being casual to being intense within the blink of an eye.\nHowever what makes this game so unique - other than the gameplay, the music, the ambience, the themes, the lore, the story, the graphics, basically everything - is the uncomprising attitude of the game designers. The boss fights in the game are insanely challenging. BUT they are all manageable with enough practice. And practice you do need. You have to grind and grind and observe and learn all the boss moves before you can even think of attacking them.\nOnce you get deep into the game, this extends to far beyond the boss fights. The late game levels are themselves quite challenging and require you to put in quite a bit of effort to clear - I’m talking about you DeepNest.\nOn top of this, there are no manuals or instructions anywhere in the game. You learn everything by doing. Even the maps are hidden at first and you’re expected to explore and learn Hollownest by exploring it.\nNow that this game is so big, the genius of Team Cherry, its creators is obvious. Their vision and commitment to it is second to none. But I wonder what their thinking process must have been while making the game. Surely they must have received feedback that some of the bosses are too difficult or that they need to make some of the levels easier to navigate otherwise gamers would lose interest. But they stuck with their convictions. They somehow trusted that the people who would play their game would have enough grit and enthusiasm to keep grinding and keep learning. This requires a great amount of faith in people and also in your own game’s ability to keep the gamers engaged.\n\nHowever, this game has had a bigger impact on my life outside of just gaming.\n\nIt has made me a little more optimistic about humanity. I’ve watched countless Hollow Knight speed runs and meme runs on YouTube now and amd constantly aware of how bad I still am at this game. But when I see the skill levels people can attain after hours of dedicated practice I feel deeply humbled and amazed. We truly are great at learning and adapting.\nIt has made me realize that I love doing hard things. Even though clearing the hard levels and the difficult boss fights is extremely stressful and challenging, it is also greatly satisfying. The pleasure at the end of the ordeal is indescribable. There are several bosses and levels in the game that I still have not cleared and I probably never will, but that no longer matters. I love just playing those fights over and over and get a little better at them every single time. What a great metaphor for life!\nThe third effect surprised me completely. This game has also affected the way I teach. My courses tend to be on the difficult side. I give students a lot of work and expect a lot from them. My exams are challenging in general and are usually a struggle. I used to feel a bit guilty about this and tried to tone myself down but I no longer feel this way. I no longer mind that my courses are hard and that my exams are challenging - as long as I’m giving students enough opportunity to practice and learn and grow it’s all worth it. Some of my students will become extremely skilled and do speed runs, but others, like me, would never be able to clear some of the harder levels. And that’s ok. The joy is in the process and not the destination."

    "title": "Love the Process",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are two ways of approaching any task and life in general:\n\ngoal oriented\nprocess oriented\n\nFor some reason, very likely a mix of cultural and biological, the default is the first approach. You do things in order to get somewhere, to accomplish something.\nOne of the most important teachings of the various contemplative traditions like Buddhism, Stoicism is that in order to find any semblance of equanimity you need to take the process oriented approach - love the process. The goal is often unattainable and impractical and even when it is attained the attainment itself is momentary and fleeting and once you’re done with it you’re left with a hollowness and a lack of direction.\nIf you want to run regularly, then you cannot make your running contingent on the next marathon. Every marathon will be over sooner than you’d like. And there will inevitably be long stretches of time in your life when you won’t be able to participate in any running events. If you truly want to become a runner then you should enjoy the process of running for its own sake. You should participate in running events because you’re a runner and not the other way around.\nThe book “Atomic Habits” has a very good way of putting this - instead of saying that you want to run, you phrase it as you want to become a runner. Instead of saying that you want to read x number of books each year, you say that you want to become an avid reader. This moves the focus from the goal to the process itself.\nYou can extend this to the broader extent of life. You cannot decide to work hard because you want to accomplish certain goals. Rather you’re able to accomplish your goals in life because you’re a hard working person. The arrow of causality points in the other direction."

Just for fun, I recently tried a Yoga Sculpt class and it kicked my ass.\nThis made me realize two things:\n\nWhen working out alone, it’s easy to not be fully honest with oneself. I probably take longer breaks, get sidetracked by my phone, or choose lighter weights when I could handle heavier ones.\nWe can often push ourselves more than we think. I never knew an hour-long HIIT session with weights, like Yoga Sculpt, was something I could do. I’m surprised I hadn’t tried it earlier.\n\nI once tried a yoga class via livestream, but it didn’t feel the same. The poses might have been identical, but the intensity was different.\nI’ve started to see the benefits of group classes. They push you harder and offer new experiences you might not encounter otherwise."

    "text": "Over the last couple of years, I lived in Chicago and couldn’t go on hikes. The land there is flatter than a pancake. It’s a perfect place for long-distance biking but an extremely boring one for hiking.\nI hiked the Loudon Heights trail at Harper’s Ferry and absolutely loved it. It was a bit tedious at first with no change in scenery - but that’s the whole point of hiking. It’s not about change, or being comfortable, or getting somewhere, but the journey itself. You walk for hours, letting your mind settle down and taking in the beauty of your surroundings. There’s a deep, ancient instinct that kicks in when you find yourself so close to nature. This feeling is hard to describe and equally hard to recollect.\nWhen I hadn’t hiked for so long, I didn’t particularly miss it, but I was also slowly forgetting how much I liked it. It is a precious thing that I hope I don’t lose as I get busy with life."

Now that I’m entering a new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, teaching learning, Lean, programming, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…\nFor me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. As the wise Feynman once said “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that.\nThe title of this post is a meditation prompt by Sam Harris. I’m serious about practicing meditation and mindfulness, but regrettably, not very good at it. Whenever I catch myself doing something I would rather not (like procrastinating writing), I just remind myself to Begin Again.\nSo here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings."

    "text": "On one of my long drives recently, I was listening to the Smartless episode featuring Willem Dafoe.\nHe shared a perspective that resonated with me. Although he’s American, he lives in Italy, making him an immigrant there. He mentioned that being an immigrant is a liberating experience for him, allowing him to see things from a distance, with an outsider’s perspective.\nI’d never considered it, but it rings true for me as well. Being an immigrant in America, I have the unique vantage point to observe the absurdities, joys, and sorrows of this place, but from a distance. Having lived in another country gives me a completely different perspective, knowing how things could be elsewhere. I can never become too myopic here, as I never get too close to things. There is a sad yet liberating quality to it."

Prior to that, I was frequently on the move, both for work and family commitments. As a result of which, my routine has been completely upended, and my habits are in complete disarray.\nI came across this post on Stoicism (something I greatly admire) which, among other things, talks about starting your day right. This made me realize how I’ve been swept up by the unproductive habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.\nFortunately, I’ve just finished assembling my writing desk by a lovely corner window. My coffee is brewing and my trusty iPad is charged. Time to get back to morning journaling again. Hopefully, even when life gets busy and chaotic, I’ll have the stamina and discipline to keep up with this incredibly useful habit.\n\n\n\nMy writing desk"
