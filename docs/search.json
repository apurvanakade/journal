Now in the new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again starting to write again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, teaching learning, Lean, programming, meditation, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…\nFor me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. Feynman once said “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that. \nSo here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Scott\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 2, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseries\n\n\nanime\n\n\njapanese\n\n\nnetflix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 26, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsciousness\n\n\nletting-go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappily Ever After\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npodcast\n\n\nhappiness-lab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeverance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseries\n\n\npodcast\n\n\ndystopia\n\n\nsci-fi\n\n\nvery-bad-wizards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Intention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeditation\n\n\nmindfulness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmindfulness\n\n\nmeditation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaying No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npodcast\n\n\noliver burkeman\n\n\nwaking up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nforeign\n\n\nthriller\n\n\ncourtroom\n\n\nbeautiful\n\n\nmovie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 25, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginner’s Mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuddhism\n\n\nzen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Fall to Your Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhabits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollow Knight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchallenging\n\n\nartsy\n\n\nbeautiful\n\n\nvideo-game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 5, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam James - Very Bad Wizards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhabits\n\n\npodcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 4, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmindfulness\n\n\nphilosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 1, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasey Neistat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhabits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPast Lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmovies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartless - Willem Dafoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npodcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Games in Baltimore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboardgames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 4, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper’s Ferry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 2, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandrayaan-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting Your Day Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstoicism\n\n\nhabits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 1, 1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeditation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 1, 1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 1, 1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncategorized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 1, 1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have a theory about what meditation practice aims to achieve by urging us to “let go”. I believe consciousness or awareness is the bare minimum state of mind required to function. It’s like the OS kernel (or is the BIOS) that loads when your computer starts, before any other program is loaded in working memory. It’s the smallest piece of software necessary to indicate that your mind has booted up.\nIn our normal existence, we run several other processes on top of it - with thinking being the most energy-consuming one. But we are also engaged in seeing, listening, reading, parsing, talking, etc. There are times when thinking is essential - after all, it’s the foundation of all modern civilization. However, most of the time, we run this program unintentionally. It becomes a runaway program that spawns many threads, each consuming significant resources - like when you have too many tabs open in your web browser.\nThe goal of meditation is to recognize these redundant threads and shut them down as necessary. It involves realizing that most of the time, you don’t need to load anything other than your OS, and just allow the processor to relax and cool down. Of course, you occasionally need several threads, and then the processor needs to shift into intensive thinking mode, but this shouldn’t be the default state.\nThis approach is akin to opening a task manager on your computer, deciding which threads are necessary, and terminating the unnecessary ones. I believe this leads to optimized brain function, declutters its RAM, and allows the brain to use its resources for more significant subconscious tasks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a podcast episode on waking up, Oliver Burkeman talks about the necessity to say no to certain things in life because you only have a finite amount of time. This becomes clear when you do the calculation involving the time available and the time required to get things done. This is further emphasized by the fact that we don’t always have the will, energy, or capacity to do the things we would like to do.\nTwo things worth pointing out:\n\nYou have to learn to say no to things that you want to do. Just yesterday, I was at a yoga class which was overcrowded. I usually love staying for the final resting pose but I knew that if I stayed until the end, it would take me forever to leave. So, reluctantly, I left early. I still got most of the benefits of the class and managed to leave on time by making a small sacrifice.\nThere is a difference between conceptually understanding something and experientially understanding it. The effect a concept has on your life is much greater once you’ve internalized it. Even though it’s obvious that you have to say no to things, we don’t always do it. And even when we do, we tend to feel guilty or irritated about it. One has to realize that there is just no alternative. This is a consequence of our finiteness that we need to accept and move on."

    "title": "Love the Process",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are two ways of approaching any task and life in general:\n\ngoal oriented\nprocess oriented\n\nFor some reason, very likely a mix of cultural and biological, the default is the first approach. You do things in order to get somewhere, to accomplish something.\nOne of the most important teachings of the various contemplative traditions like Buddhism, Stoicism is that in order to find any semblance of equanimity you need to take the process oriented approach - love the process. The goal is often unattainable and impractical and even when it is attained the attainment itself is momentary and fleeting and once you’re done with it you’re left with a hollowness and a lack of direction.\nIf you want to run regularly, then you cannot make your running contingent on the next marathon. Every marathon will be over sooner than you’d like. And there will inevitably be long stretches of time in your life when you won’t be able to participate in any running events. If you truly want to become a runner then you should enjoy the process of running for its own sake. You should participate in running events because you’re a runner and not the other way around.\nThe book “Atomic Habits” has a very good way of putting this - instead of saying that you want to run, you phrase it as you want to become a runner. Instead of saying that you want to read x number of books each year, you say that you want to become an avid reader. This moves the focus from the goal to the process itself.\nYou can extend this to the broader extent of life. You cannot decide to work hard because you want to accomplish certain goals. Rather you’re able to accomplish your goals in life because you’re a hard working person. The arrow of causality points in the other direction."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I came across a very interesting idea on a Happiness Lab adjacent podcast\nThanks to Disney fairy tales, or perhaps even before Disney, the phrase “happily ever after” has become commonplace in our society. This phrase seems to suggest that there is a “final state of happiness” which is the goal of life, and once achieved, life remains that way.\nThis might sound benign, and at best, like a concept for children. However, it’s very possible that the phrase has become ingrained in our collective psyche without us realizing it. Subconsciously, we may find ourselves striving to achieve this elusive goal in life.\nThe central teaching of Buddhism, which is essentially common sense, states that life is defined by change. No state is permanent, except death. Desiring and pursuing something impermanent is the cause of human suffering.\nI find it fascinating that we might have created this illusory goal for ourselves without intending any harm, yet now we are suffering the consequences of this delusion."

    "text": "I’m putting this post here mainly as a bookmark to myself. Sam Harris mentioned this podcast in one of his discussions and so I had a listen.\nI don’t remember much about it’s content but I remember thinking just how much William James already knew about psychology and how well he understood the the human mind to make all these claims without doing any scientific research. Of course, he must have read several religious and philosophical texts of his time and infered based on them. But to synthesize something so precise and practical from these abstract and often incorrect sources is nothing short of genius. Having never done any experiments, his claims cannot be called scientific or even emperical, nevertheless as works of fiction and philosophy they contain great ideas that we can investigate today using the scientific method.\nMy recollection is that in his thesis James concludes that the human society relies entirely on habits and that there is no greater endeavor than to develop good habits. He even lays out some suggestions as to how to go about doing this. I couldn’t agree more.\nI will listen to this episode again and take notes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Netflix has created a masterpiece with Blue Eye Samurai.\nThere are some standard tropes - lonely samurai, mad skilled, dark past, revenge/mercenary for hire, amateur and naive apprentice, etc. A female protagonist with non-japanese ancestry adds a bit of novelty but not sufficient enough and the first couple of episodes feel pretty standard.\nBut then as the characters develop and the backstory is revealed, the show really takes off. I distinctly remember watching S1E5 - The Ronin and the Bride - and unable to contain myself with excitement. There is a play in the episode - a story within a story - that is used to reveal Mizo’s past. This is sheer genius. They could have just shown her backstory and the episode would still have been good. But this incorporation of a Japanese myth being told as a play which then parallels Mizu’s life makes this episode great.\nAnother great thing about this show is that it not emotionless, stoic, cool as many samurai shows tend to be. Sure Mizu is cold-hearted at times but the show has a warmth and gritty authenticity that is very rare. The ending of S1E5, for example, is heart wrenching. If you did not shed a tear or get goosebumps watching this episode, you are a psychopath."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I saw Severance a while back when it was released but was reminded of it by a brilliant episode of Very Bad Wizards.\nI enjoy reading and watching sci-fi dystopian worlds. It is one of my favorite genres, one that sci-fi explores particularly well. However, rarely do any of these stories get under my skin. Even the deeply poignant ones with no redemptive qualities, like Blade Runner, never perturbed me. I was moved by it emotionally and might have shed a tear at the final scene, but I was feeling things from a distance.\nWith Severance, though, I felt viscerally disturbed. Even just thinking about it makes me squirm in my chair. It is somewhat reminiscent of 1984. I can feel myself being a part of this world. I feel all the frustration and absurdity that the characters experience. I understand their coping mechanisms.\nThe dark humor of the series makes it more palatable for me than 1984. But it is still a hard watch. It is one of my favorite series, and yet I shudder at the thought of watching it again. I know that I will watch the second season when it comes out, but it will be with a mix of awe and anxiety.\nFinally, the most disturbing aspects of both Severance and 1984 are the abject helplessness and the utter lack of hope. You can just feel the unfairness of the world trampling upon everyone, and none of the characters have any chance of escaping. Because Severance is aimed at the ever-optimistic American audience, I just know that in the second season the “small guys” are going to win. But if this series were to stay honest and live up to its true potential, they shouldn’t. This series should follow the same unyielding path as 1984. Some stories do need to end in a tragedy."

    "text": "Hollow Knight is one of the best video games I’ve ever played. I used to play a lot of games during my school and college days but took a break during grad school. I recently resumed playing video games and stumbled upon Hollow Knight by chance.\nI began the game unenthusiastically, assuming it would be about a cute little bug navigating Hallownest. I was completely mistaken. This is one of the most brutal and challenging games ever made. The realization hits when you face your first boss. The game shifts from casual to intense in an instant.\nWhat sets this game apart – aside from the gameplay, music, ambiance, themes, lore, story, graphics, essentially everything – is the uncompromising attitude of the designers. The boss fights are insanely challenging, but they are manageable with enough practice. You need to grind, observe, and learn all the boss moves before even thinking of attacking them.\nAs you delve deeper into the game, the challenge extends beyond the boss fights. The late-game levels, like DeepNest, are tough and require significant effort to clear.\nFurthermore, the game lacks manuals or instructions. You learn by doing. Even the maps are initially hidden, encouraging you to explore and learn Hallownest through exploration.\nNow that the game is popular, the genius of Team Cherry, its creators, is evident. Their vision and commitment are unparalleled. But I wonder about their thought process during development. They must have received feedback about the difficulty of some bosses or the need for easier navigation, yet they remained true to their convictions. They trusted that players would possess the grit and enthusiasm to keep grinding and learning, a testament to their faith in people and their game’s ability to engage players.\n\nOutside gaming, Hollow Knight has impacted my life significantly.\n\nIt has made me more optimistic about humanity. Watching countless speedruns and meme runs on YouTube, I’m constantly aware of my skill level. Seeing the heights people can reach with dedicated practice is humbling and amazing. It shows our great capacity for learning and adapting.\nIt has made me realize my love for challenges. Despite the stress and difficulty of clearing hard levels and boss fights, the satisfaction at the end is immense. There are bosses and levels I may never clear, but I enjoy improving with each attempt. It’s a wonderful metaphor for life.\nSurprisingly, it has also influenced my teaching. My courses are challenging, and my exams are generally tough. I used to feel guilty and considered toning it down, but not anymore. I don’t mind the difficulty of my courses or exams, as long as they provide students with ample opportunity to practice, learn, and grow. Some students may excel and do ‘speedruns’, while others might struggle with harder levels – and that’s okay. The joy lies in the process, not the destination."

    "text": "On one of my long drives recently, I was listening to the Smartless episode featuring Willem Dafoe.\nHe shared a perspective that resonated with me. Although he’s American, he lives in Italy, making him an immigrant there. He mentioned that being an immigrant is a liberating experience for him, allowing him to see things from a distance, with an outsider’s perspective.\nI’d never considered it, but it rings true for me as well. Being an immigrant in America, I have the unique vantage point to observe the absurdities, joys, and sorrows of this place, but from a distance. Having lived in another country gives me a completely different perspective, knowing how things could be elsewhere. I can never become too myopic here, as I never get too close to things. There is a sad yet liberating quality to it."

While my life isn’t as dramatic as the characters’, there is something about the immigrant experience that is so uniquely captured by the film.\nNot too far into the movie, you realize that there cannot be any happy ending here. Every ending is going to be sorrowful in its own way - and isn’t that true about life itself? Yet you endure with patience, waiting for your chance to cry at an incomplete catharsis.\nThis could be one of the finest films I’ve ever watched."

I probably take longer breaks, get sidetracked by my phone, or choose lighter weights when I could handle heavier ones.\nWe can often push ourselves more than we think. I never knew an hour-long HIIT session with weights, like Yoga Sculpt, was something I could do. I’m surprised I hadn’t tried it earlier.\n\nI once tried a yoga class via livestream, but it didn’t feel the same. The poses might have been identical, but the intensity was different.\nI’ve started to see the benefits of group classes. They push you harder and offer new experiences you might not encounter otherwise."

I immediately realized that this wasn’t another internet troll but a master at his craft.\nI love that when I open his videos, most of the time I do not know what’s going to happen. And yet, I’m somehow convinced that the video is going to go well! Behind his “bro” facade he is a master storyteller. Rather, his “bro” facade is part of his storytelling act.\nI also love his cinematography, editing, music mixing, just everything. Never a boring video.\nI’m writing all this because I learned about his work ethic and feel very inspired by it. For quite some time now, I have been struggling with my sleep and work routine. I’m slowly improving but as I’m writing this I’m realizing that I lack role models in this area. The people in my life either don’t do work they like or work hard obsessively for the sake or working hard. But now I have Neistat! He is someone whose work and skill I admire and understand and whose work ethic I hope to emulate.\nI hope that this is the kick I needed to pull myself up by the bootstraps. Of course, I feel very motivated and inspired now but the real test is whether this is going to last. Only time will tell."

As a result of which, my routine has been completely upended, and my habits are in complete disarray.\nI came across this post on Stoicism (something I greatly admire) which, among other things, talks about starting your day right. This made me realize how I’ve been swept up by the unproductive habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.\nFortunately, I’ve just finished assembling my writing desk by a lovely corner window. My coffee is brewing and my trusty iPad is charged. Time to get back to morning journaling again. Hopefully, even when life gets busy and chaotic, I’ll have the stamina and discipline to keep up with this incredibly useful habit.\n\n\n\nMy writing desk"

    "section": "",
    "text": "James Clear, the author of “Atomic Habits,” has a quote: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”\nI experienced this just today. I completed a five-day hiking trip through the Mojave Desert in Joshua Tree National Park. It was difficult, tiring, exhilarating, and rewarding - everything you’d expect. On the long walks, I brainstormed ways to improve my life, made many plans for the future, and ended up feeling very optimistic.\nHowever, when the trip ended, I just crashed. Surprisingly, I was not mentally or physically exhausted and needed no time to recover. But I had lost my “systems.” During the hikes, I woke up, had breakfast, drove to the trailheads, hiked, returned to the campsite, had dinner, and went to bed. This routine was my daily pattern. Suddenly, I needed to decide what to do next, and I couldn’t do it effectively. I ended up wasting an entire day watching meaningless videos.\n“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”\nTo maintain the mental state I achieved during the trip and act on any of the ideas I had, the first thing I need to do is develop good “systems,” i.e., habits and routines. These need to be simple and maintainable.\nMy first goal, which is more of a habit, is to wake up every day at 6 a.m., no matter what. If I go to bed late, too bad for me. I will also try to avoid drinking coffee, taking naps during the day, and consuming alcohol. The latter are not difficult as long as I can stick to the first one.\nIf possible, I’d also like to go for a run, walk, or bike ride as soon as I wake up. When I was hiking, one thing I loved was waking up to the fresh, cold morning air. I suspect it set an uplifting tone for the rest of the day."

However, hearing this quote at the end of a science podcast really caught me off-guard and made me see it from a different perspective. I can’t pinpoint exactly what this feeling is, but I feel a tingling sensation hinting at something deeper.\nWhat is it that I’m not seeing? Is it related to my life? My work? Teaching? Meditation?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Be Here Now,” the classic book by Ram Dass, is supposed to encapsulate the project of meditation. The more I struggle with meditation, the more I realize how central this principle is to the practice.\nMy brain is constantly future-looking, sometimes in small ways - I might be brewing coffee and simultaneously thinking about the joy of drinking it afterwards, or I might be biking to work while thinking of what I’m going to do in class today - and sometimes in large ways - I might be doing something mundane like laundry while worrying about my career and long-term future. We are genetically, culturally, and habitually in this constant state of chasing the future.\nWhy is this bad? Because it represents habituation and a lack of intention. One of the goals of mindfulness is the recognition of conditioning and intentionally choosing to either do something or not. Of course, future planning is a good thing, but it does not need to be done constantly. You need to decide to plan for the future, take care of it, and then let go and return to the present.\nIt is, of course, easier said than done. I am not sure if it is even possible to be fully present in the current moment. But mindfulness teachings come to the rescue again - the goal is never the reason to do something; the process is. You need to enjoy this process of recognizing that the mind is future-looking and decide if this is where you want it to be. Whether you want it or not, you just make a decision and let go."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the best “hacks” for being mindful and present is to set intentions before starting any task. This includes tasks like planning and concentrated thinking. You just “let your brain know” that this is what it needs to be doing now and it can return to other tasks afterward.\nThis aligns with the analogy that the brain is a blind automaton with different parts working in parallel. There is communication between the various parts, but this communication is often delayed and imperfect. By setting intentions, you are sending a strong message from one part of the brain to another.\nLike right now, there is a lot of chaos happening around me. My internet is down, and I’m supposed to be in a meeting. I have a bunch of deadlines today and I need to get back to planning several things soon. If I just let my mind wander, it will keep jumping from one task to another without actually resolving anything, just increasing my anxiety. Instead, I have decided, as much as possible, that this is my writing time. I do still get thoughts about other things and keep a notebook with me to jot them down to return to them after I’m done. But having this clear intention of writing is essential for me to make it to the end of this sentence with full commitment."

It’s a perfect place for long-distance biking but an extremely boring one for hiking.\nI hiked the Loudon Heights trail at Harper’s Ferry and absolutely loved it. It was a bit tedious at first with no change in scenery - but that’s the whole point of hiking. It’s not about change, or being comfortable, or getting somewhere, but the journey itself. You walk for hours, letting your mind settle down and taking in the beauty of your surroundings. There’s a deep, ancient instinct that kicks in when you find yourself so close to nature. This feeling is hard to describe and equally hard to recollect.\nWhen I hadn’t hiked for so long, I didn’t particularly miss it, but I was also slowly forgetting how much I liked it. It is a precious thing that I hope I don’t lose as I get busy with life."
