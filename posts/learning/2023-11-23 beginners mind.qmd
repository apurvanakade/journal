I was listening to this [radiolab podcast](insert link here) that ends with Suzuki Roshi's quote - 
"A beginner's mind is ... but an expert's mind ... "

I have never given this too much thought as I'm not much attracted to the Zen traditions of Koans and contradictions. However, hearing this quote at the end of a science podcast really caught off-gaurd and made me see it from a different perspective. I cannot pinpoint exactly what this feeling is but I can feel a tingling sensation that hints at something deeper. 

What is it that I'm not seeing? Is it about my life? My work? Teaching? Meditation?
