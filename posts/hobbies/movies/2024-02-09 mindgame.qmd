Weird as fuck is the only was to describe this movie - at least at the start.

The movie follows a sad, little guy who is stuck in self-pity. Then some random events happen and he gets stuck with 3 other characters on a cast-away type of situation. 
The rest of the movie is the 4 of them shedding their fake shells and discovering their true selves.
I have been thinking about these same things lately and this movie almost feels like it's written personally for me. 

And the story isn't even the biggest strength of the movie. The visuals, animation style, fractured narrative arcs, unique characters, hilarious chase sequences - all are absolutely top notch.
