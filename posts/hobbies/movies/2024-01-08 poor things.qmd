After watching the trailer, I was very reluctant to watch Poor Things. 
But one boring Saturday I had nothing else to do so I watched it in a theater and am I glad I did. 
What a visual feast! There was not a dull moment in the movie. 
It felt like I would miss something important if I blinked.
Emma Watson and Mark Ruffalo are an absolute delight to watch.
Now I need to watch other movies by this genius director.
