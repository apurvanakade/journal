I never imagined that I would like a Kaiju movie. 
I never understood about their point or their attraction. 
But Godzilla Minus One was a really good movie. 
The Godzilla is a metaphor for nuclear holocaust, a force of nature, a tragedy too big to control.
Even though it is the central plo point and the story revolves around it, it simply presents the background in which the characters evolve. 
Godzilla minus one is really the story of a failed Kamikaze pilot who finally finds courage and closure and a way to reconcile with his past. 
And also a peek into the aftermath of WW2 in Tokyo.
