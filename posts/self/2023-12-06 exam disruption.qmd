In my most productive days, I consistently track my time using Toggl. I switch the timer as I switch activities, ensuring my entire day is logged. However, this system isn't completely stable for me and tends to fail when disruptions occur in my life.

Lately, I haven't been keeping track of my time, and I can pinpoint the last significant disruption to the second exam of my course! I've always known that exams are a major stressor for me, but I didn't realize the impact was so pronounced.

This realization of course does not remove the stressor but now I know what to look out for after the exam.
