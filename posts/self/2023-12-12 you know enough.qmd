I've been feeling a bit irritated, scattered, and frustrated lately. Recent chaos in my life has triggered this state of mind.

I've noticed that I keep listening to meditation podcasts and Dharma talks, subconsciously hoping that they'll help my mind settle down. However, I'm reminded of a point Sam Harris makes in one of his conversations (I'm paraphrasing): there's only so much conceptual knowledge you need to acquire from others. Sure, you can continue listening to these full-time meditators and gain new insights, but that won't significantly impact your life. You need to accept that **you know enough**. Now it's time to buckle down and take extreme ownership.

For me, this means recognizing that my state of frustration and irritation won't dissipate if I bombard myself with Buddhist wisdom. I need to accept that I am responsible for this state. Although my circumstances triggered it, I am the one sustaining and aggravating it by being myopic and undisciplined.

I know what I need to do. I need to stop searching for more knowledge from others and accept my state for what it is, working on it in ways **I already know**. The promise of meditation is not happiness, but liberation. With a sufficient understanding of self, hopefully, this state will pass sooner rather than later.
