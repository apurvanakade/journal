I was under some stress and anxiety, which, looking back, was completely unnecessary and self-imposed, but did not feel so in the midst of it. Then, suddenly, yesterday, it thawed and gradually went away. I'm trying to figure out what helped me alleviate it.

The simplest reason was perhaps that I had a lot of free time with no deadlines, so I could spend more time contemplating, meditating, and self-observing, thereby appreciating the absurdity of it. This is, of course, the closest we can get to a panacea - the solution to all your problems is to look at yourself inwardly, and given enough time and attention, things would resolve. But I do not always have the luxury to take such long breaks. Perhaps this means that I'm doomed, and when life gets busy, I will get stressed and anxious. All I can do is take small breaks and try to maintain a functional state of anxiety. Which brings me to my second point.

You don't have to eliminate stress and anxiety. What really sent the ball rolling down the hill for me was a deep realization and acceptance of the fact that life is just hard. There is no reason for it to be otherwise. Sometimes, when something goes in your favor, you start subconsciously hoping for a "happily ever after." But such a state is purely mythical.

Another realization I had was that, while it is true that things are not all well for me, I just know that sometime, at an unknown time, at an unknown place, things are going to get much worse. I will have some unbearable emotional or physical pain, and if I expect to find equanimity then, I better find equanimity now when things are mostly good with a few wrinkles.

Life is hard, but that's ok.
