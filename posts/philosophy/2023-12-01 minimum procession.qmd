I have a theory that "consciousness" or "awareness and attention" mechanisms are some kind of baseline functionalities. They are like the XServer on you Linux machine that is much higher level than the kernel but still sits below all GUI applications. 

My theory is that on of the goals of meditation is to relax the mind enough so that it only loads consciouness and nothing else, unless it needs it. So you're not running any redundant programs but just what is needed to sustain and are thereby conserving mental energy.
