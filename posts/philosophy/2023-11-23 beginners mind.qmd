I was listening to a [Radiolab podcast](https://radiolab.org/podcast/interstitium) that concluded with a quote by Suzuki Roshi: *"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few."* 

I've never given this much thought, as I'm not particularly drawn to the Zen traditions of koans and contradictions. However, hearing this quote at the end of a science podcast really caught me off-guard and made me see it from a different perspective. I can't pinpoint exactly what this feeling is, but I feel a tingling sensation hinting at something deeper.

What is it that I'm not seeing? Is it related to my life? My work? Teaching? Meditation?
